# Expanding the W65C265SXB

The 50-pin Xbus265 on the left side of the board allows expanding the 265SXB
with smaller plug-in boards, also known as "daughter boards", or "shields". 

## Additional 1 MB of RAM

This daughter board uses two AS6C4008 512K SRAM chips and one ATF16V8CZ-15PU PLD
to add 1 MB of SRAM in the banks C0 to FF.
