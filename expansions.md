# Expanding the W65C265SXB

The 50-pin Xbus265 on the left side of the board allows expanding the 265SXB
with smaller plug-in boards, also known as "daughter boards", or "shields". 

## Additional 1 MB of RAM

This daughter board created by Andrew Jacobs uses two [AS6C4008 512K SRAM
chips](http://www.alliancememory.com/pdf/as6c4008.pdf) and one [ATF16V8CZ-15PU
PLD](http://www.mouser.com/ds/2/36/doc0453-35248.pdf) to add 1 MB of SRAM in the
banks C0 to FF.
