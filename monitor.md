# The 265SXB's built-in monitor program

The 265SXB is shipped with a small built-in operating system, the Mensch Monitor
(MM). As of time of writing (Jan 2016), the build shipped with the board was
2.0 from 1995. That made it more than 20 years old.

The MM is "burned" into the board and cannot be removed, replaced, or
overwritten. 

> Because of this, no backup is needed. 

However, you are able to jump from it to other ROM areas (if installed) and even
mask it completely. The [Mensch Monitor
Manual](http://www.westerndesigncenter.com/Wdc/documentation/265monrom.pdf)
describes these steps in more detail.
