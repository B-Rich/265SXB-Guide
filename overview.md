# Overview of the W65C265SXB

The
[W65C265SXB](http://wdc65xx.com/65xx-store/sxb-boards/w65c265sxb-engineering-development-system/)
is a single board computer (SBC) - formally a "Engineering Development System" -
created by WDC around the W65C265S 8/16-bit microcomputer. This in turn has the
65816 microprocessor at its core, the big sibling of the famous 8-bit 6502
microprocessor that powered the Apple II, VIC-20, and others. 

> About those names: Note the number is "265", not "256" as you might assume,
> which is a regular source of typos. "SXB" stands for "Standard chip 
> Xxcelr8r Board". Because the name is such a mouthful, we use "265SXB" as a
> short form for the board in this document.
