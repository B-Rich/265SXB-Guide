# A Most Very Unofficial Guide to the W65C265SXB

Scot W. Stevenson <scot.stevenson@gmail.com>

The W65C265SXB ("265SXB" for short) is an engineering development board produced
-- basically a single-board computer in the same sense as the Raspberry Pi -- by
the Western Design Center (WDC). It is based on the W65C265S microcontroler,
which in turn has a 65816 MPU at its core -- the 8/16-bit hybrid "big sibling"
of the famous 6502 MPU that powered famous computers such as the VC-20 and Apple
II. Because of the hybrid nature of the 65816, the 265SXB is pretty much the
simplest way to get started with a classic 6502 system.

This document is an unofficial guide to setting up, programming, expanding, and
using the 265SXB. It supplements the official documentation provided by WDC.
